# MinDepthCompiler
This project is divided into two programs: a preprocessor (`src/preprocessor.py`) that takes in a Domino `.c` program and outputs it into a `.in` file, and a compiler (`src/main.py`) that takes in a `.in` file, an argument specifying the folder in which intermediate sketch files can be written to, and an argument specifying the output P4 program filename, and generates an optimized P4 program. To call the preprocessor, run
```
cd src/ && python3 ./preprocessor.py <Domino .c file> <output .in file>
```
To run the main compiler, you need to take a `.in` file generated by the preprocessor, and run
```
cd src/ && python3 ./main.py <path to .in file> <path to a directory for temporary files> <path to output .p4 program>
```
Along the way, the compiler will use the Graphviz `dot` command to generate and display the mid-end dependency graph and components graph as PDFs.

## Python Dependencies
Python version: 3.5 or up
```
PLY  
networkx  
graphviz  
overrides 
jinja2 
gurobipy
```
Note that only having the pip3 graphviz package is not enough; please make sure the Graphviz `dot`-language compiler is installed on your system and available in the `PATH`. 

To install `dot` on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install graphviz
```

To install `dot` on macOS/OSX: Make sure to have Homebrew installed, and run
```
brew install graphviz
```

## Non-python dependencies
Sketch-1.7.6

## Testing

To run tests on one of the passing benchmarks, simply go and locate the `test_*.sh` files in the main directory and run it in the main directory. The script will tell you where to find the generated `.p4` file.

## Running the code

Go to the src directory ("cd src").

Use the command "python3 preprocessor.py \<input Domino program\> \<output file\>" to generate the preprocessed code.    

Use the command "python3 main.py \<input preprocessed file\> \<output directory\>" to generate code by querying Sketch. Sketch input files will be created in \<output directory\>.

## Currently passing tests
If there is a corrsponding `.sh` file in the main directory, then the test is passing. All tests are located in the `stable_benchmarks/` folder.
## Project structure
This is a developmental fork of Divya's repository at https://github.com/divya-urs/minDepthCompiler. We periodically merge commits into that repository, and all issues are reported at the stable repo: https://github.com/divya-urs/minDepthCompiler/issues. All source code are located in `src/`. Benchmarks (tests) are located in `benchmarks/`. The program `src/preprocessor.py` takes in a Domino `.c` file and converts it into a `.in` file, used as input for the main compiler `src/main.py`. The main compiler at `src/main.py` currently takes in a `.in` file, outputs intermediate Sketch files to a user-specified folder location, and prints out the P4 program in stdout. It is WIP to add a command line arg for the main program to export P4 code to a user-specified file, as well as specifying loglevel / having better debug messages.

## Refactoring
Some refactoring is being done to the compiler at `new_src/`. The main idea is to refactor everything into transformation and analysis passes that operate on the components graph in the mid-end, and the ALU dependency graph in the codegen. There will also be a pass manager that schedules all the passes. This is on the back-burner as we are still fixing various issues involved with compiling everything in `benchmarks/` folder correctly.
